            <h2>Apizza</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Apizza (pronounced "ah-beets") is a popular type of pizza in New Haven, Connecticut characterized by its prolonged baking time in extremely hot coal ovens and the high moisture content of the dough. Due to these two defining characteristics, the result is a pizza with a thin, black, crispy, and charred crust that might appear to be burnt, but instead has a deliciously chewy texture and flavor.</p>
